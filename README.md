A program that stores your plans for a week. Each plan needs a start-
and an end-time, given to the nearest whole minute. You should choose between
loading a plan, adding information to a plan, showing the current plan, and
saving the current plan.
The plan should be saved in a file, so you can load it again later with the
same program.
